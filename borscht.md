Ingredients: 

2 stewpans - one is main = 5 litres, second is for beet

potatoes - 12 items of average size, neither big nor small

beet - 4 items of average size

meat - a piece of pork without fat, size about 10x17x7 santimeters

salt, sugar, spieces - required to create the taste, as much as you wish


What to do with ingredients:

1. Take the meat. Take the sharp knife. Cut the meat to pieces around 4x2x1 santimeters.

2. Take the stewpan for beet, not 5 litres, and boil the water there, use the biggest fire.

3. Throw the beet, clean but with peel into boiled water.
Don't add any spieces. 
Leave it for 3 or more hours. 
Beet is very different, sometimes it becomes ready after 3 hours, but sometimes 4.
It should become soft and easy to cut.
During you cook beet - please, carefully watch if there is enough amount of water inside the stewpan.
Just to prevent the disaster

2*. Take the stewpan and fill it with water. Paste in to the cook. Big fire. Let the water boil

3*. Throw the meat into boiled water. Put the cover upon the can. 
Adjust the fire to let the water keep boiling without exceeding the upper limit of the can. 
Be safe. 
It will take nearly 1,5 hour for meet to be ready.

4. Right after you have thrown the meat there is very important step. 
You should create the taste of the whole Borshtch now. 
Add salt, sugar and spieces as you wish. 
Don't forget to taste the water at the end to check it's tasty or needs corrections

5. After you are done with putting meat to the hott water and set the timer to 1,5 hours - peel potatoes.
Then cut potatoes into the pieces you would like to see in your Borshtch.

6. At these step you should already have the beet ready - first
And second - it should be 1,5 hours since your meet is situated in the boiling water
These two are prerequisites

7. Cut the beet into small pieces 30x5x2 millimeters.
Don't forget to peel the beet before cutting

8. Throw the cut potatoes and cut beet into the stewpan with meet
Wait until potatoes becomes ready

9. Taste the whole taste of Borshtch. Fix it if you want and know how

10. That's it. Turn off the fire please. 


I always start with beet first
I leave it cookibg with 3 hours timer
In parallel I do meat
All in all ideally when the time of cooking meat is an hour and a half - beet should be already
I mean ready for throwing to the stewpan of meet
So it should be cut.
The same for potatoes

After all, add the spoon of sour cream to your plate of borshtch.

# Stuffed Peppers

**Ingredients:**

Meat - it may be pork or pork and beef. The size depends on how much you can eat.

Rice - depends on the amount of meat. It should be later mixed with stuff. Wait for instructions below.

Bell Peppers - as many as you want to eat. Usually you should be able to fill the cooking container with all of peppers. 

Salt, sugar and spices if you'd like.


**Cooking Process:**

1. We need to be determined how many peppers we want to eat and how many of them would fit the container. 
2. Wash the peppers and very very carefully extract the core and all seeds from the peppers, like [here] (http://hitrostidomashnie.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DSC04861_1-e1420460473504.jpg). 
3. Now we would start to make a chopped meat (or ground meat) from the meat piece. We will use it to put it inside the peppers later. Make sure that amount of meat should be both not too much and not too little to fill the peppers. At the end of chopping we should get something like [this] (https://www.google.com/search?q=mincemeat&es_sm=93&biw=1242&bih=575&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMI8ubby-28xwIVRzkUCh27cA5Y#tbm=isch&q=ground+meat).
4. Now after we have the meat all chopped, we should open the rice pack and add some rice to the meat. Don't add too much rice, because after the dish is ready rice would grow in size after temperature processing. So add the rice just approximately.
5. Add salt, sugar and spices.. all you want. Sometimes bell peppers are sweet, sometimes they are less sweet - then it would make sense to add a bit of sugar. Mix everything until it would be all even.
6. Fill the peppers with what you've just made.
7. If you want, put mayonnaise on top of each pepper.
8. Put all into cooking container. It should be closed very good, at least with foil or something for professionally cooking meat in the oven.
9. Put it into the oven on the temperature 200 Celcius. Cooking time is 3 hours. After two hours you may decrease the temperature down to 180. After 2 hours and 45 minutes open the cover, or unfoil the container to make peppers browened a bit.
10. Be aware that even though it smells very tasty it's very hot, careful :)
